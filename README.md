RoWatch is the first, free Moderation spectate ui!
With RoWatch you can;

* Easily have ingame reports.
* Link it with your own systems
* Customize it to your game

**How It Works**
Using our system API, you can create custom solutions for reporting.
Add systems such as autoreporting when anticheat detects them cheating, or allow player reporting!
